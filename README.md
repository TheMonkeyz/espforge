# espforge

espforge is a starting point for ESP32 firmware (ESP-IDF v5.5.4) developed mostly by an AI agent, Claude Code, with
a person deciding and trying things. It is the framework and the working method extracted from
[esp32-s3-weather](https://github.com/TheMonkeyz/esp32-s3-weather), a weather display built that way in six days
(~30 releases). It gives you: firmware components for Wi-Fi setup (setup network, captive portal, Easy Connect), a
settings web page over HTTPS with a per-device key, updates over Wi-Fi with rollback from a GitHub Pages site,
diagnostics and a USB test console; PC tools that let the agent flash, probe and test the board without a person
(a file-based flash helper, a test harness with a performance baseline, screenshots, host unit tests, browser tests
of the settings page); CI that builds, tests and publishes releases; and the lessons that made those tools necessary
([docs/LESSONS.md](docs/LESSONS.md)). The repository itself builds a small starter app for the Waveshare
ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75.

## Try it on the board

**[Install from the web flasher](https://themonkeyz.github.io/espforge/)**: plug the Waveshare
ESP32-S3-Touch-AMOLED-1.75 into a computer by USB, open the page in Chrome or Edge (desktop; they can talk to USB
devices), pick **Stable** or **Beta** (release candidates) and press Install. Then set up Wi-Fi from your phone with
the display's setup network or Easy Connect (press and hold the screen). Later versions arrive over Wi-Fi: the display
offers them on its system screen and on its settings page. Release notes: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md); all builds:
[Releases](https://github.com/TheMonkeyz/espforge/releases).

## The loop

```
  change ──► test build, labelled above the release ──► flash + probe (devloop, test console)
                                                              │
                                                              ▼
  the user tries it ◄── prove it on the device (harness, snapshots, baseline)
         │
         ▼
  "document and commit" ──► Claude tags vX.Y.Z-rc.N ──► CI ──► Pages Beta channel
                                                                     │
                                                                     ▼
                         stable vX.Y.Z (user's OK) ◄── harness --ota installs and tests it
```

Every few releases a read-only evaluation turns into a fix plan, worked one release candidate per group.
Details: [docs/WORKFLOW.md](docs/WORKFLOW.md).

## Quick start

Prerequisites (Windows; Linux works for everything except the PC-as-phone Wi-Fi tests):

- [ESP-IDF v5.5.4](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/v5.5.4/esp32s3/get-started/) (the Windows
  installer puts it in `C:\Espressif\esp-idf`).
- Python 3.10+ (python.org rather than the Microsoft Store build, see L146), Node.js 22 for the page tests, WSL
  (Ubuntu) with gcc and make for the host tests, [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) for releases.
- The board on USB. [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) in the project folder.

Build (PowerShell):

```powershell
. C:\Espressif\esp-idf\export.ps1
idf.py -B build\v55 -D SDKCONFIG=build\v55\sdkconfig build
```

Flash through the helper (it owns the COM port and keeps a log window open while the agent acts):

```powershell
tools\devloop\start_flash_helper.bat            # once, in its own window
python tools\devloop\stage.py                   # copy the parts under unique names, check md5
python tools\devloop\devloop.py flash 120       # flash, then log 120 s to .devloop\serial_log.txt
```

Test everything:

```powershell
python tools\harness\harness.py                 # all suites; report in tools\harness\reports\<date>\
```

On first boot the display opens its setup network (`Forge-Setup`); join it with a phone, or scan the Easy Connect
code, and give it your Wi-Fi. The settings page is then at `https://<ip>/` (the address is in the log line
`web: Settings page: https://<ip>/`).

## The starter app

Two pages to swipe between, plus Wi-Fi setup on a long-press. Swipes follow the finger at ~66 fps: forge_lvgl's
`slide.c` draws them as pictures copied straight to the panel (LVGL's own scrolling managed ~24 fps).

- **hello**: clock and date; the place to start your own UI.
- **system**: firmware version, Wi-Fi, address, memory, uptime, update status, and the settings page's QR code.
- **setup** / **setup1**: Wi-Fi setup, two pages of their own pager: the setup network's QR code, and Easy Connect's
  (a faint placeholder until the code is ready, then it fades in).

The settings page (`https://<ip>/`) shows device info, Wi-Fi (scan and save), language (English / français) and
updates (channel, check, install, release notes). Everything visible goes through i18n; French is Canadian French.
