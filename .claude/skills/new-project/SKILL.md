description: Turn a fresh copy of the espforge template into a new project - rename app, repo, OTA site and setup network, reset the changelog and baseline, start the project docs, and list the GitHub settings the owner must make. Use when the user starts a new device project from this template or asks to rename the project.

# New project from the template

Follow `docs/NEW-PROJECT.md`; this is the order of work.

1. **Ask the user** for the four names if not given: app (C identifier, e.g. `kitchen_timer`), repo
   (`owner/name`), OTA site (`https://<owner>.github.io/<name>/`, derived from repo unless they say otherwise),
   setup network name. Warn that the OTA site can never change once devices are out (L130).
2. **`forge.json`:** `app`, `repo`, `ota_site` (trailing `/`), `setup_ssid`, `screens`; `screen` and `chip` only for a
   different board.
3. **Root `CMakeLists.txt`:** `project(<app>)`; board line `set(EXTRA_COMPONENT_DIRS boards/<board>)`.
4. **`sdkconfig.defaults`:** `CONFIG_FORGE_SETUP_SSID`, `CONFIG_FORGE_OTA_SITE`, `CONFIG_FORGE_TLS_NAME`,
   `CONFIG_FORGE_REPO`. Delete `build\v55\sdkconfig`.
5. **Reset:** `CHANGELOG.md` to the header plus `## v0.1.0-rc.1 - <today>`; `tools/harness/baseline.json` to `{}`;
   `tools/harness/app_suites.py` to the app's suites (or an empty registry).
6. **Docs:** copy `docs/templates/HISTORY.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` to `docs/`, fill the hardware and the first
   timeline entry; README's user section; CLAUDE.md "Working setup" for this PC and board (leave the three growing
   sections empty with their one-line instructions).
7. **Leftovers:** `git grep -n -i "espforge\|Forge-Setup"` and fix each hit except the framework's own `forge_*`
   names and docs/LESSONS.md's history.
8. **Build and flash** with the `build-flash-probe` skill; check the setup network's name and `ota: Running`.
9. **Baseline:** `python tools/harness/harness.py --update-baseline`, review `baseline.proposed.json`, copy it over.
10. **Commit** (with the user's go-ahead), then give the owner the GitHub checklist from docs/NEW-PROJECT.md §3
    (Pages source, github-pages tag rule `v*`, tag ruleset). First release: docs/RELEASING.md "First release".
