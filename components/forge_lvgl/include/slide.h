// Moves drawn as pictures copied straight to the panel (~60 fps) instead of LVGL redrawing every widget for every
// frame (~25 fps for a simple full screen, 10-15 for a busy one: weather_amoled, docs/LESSONS.md "LVGL").
//
// - The picture of the screen shown follows the panel (every area LVGL flushes is copied into it), so a move never
//   waits for it. The current page's neighbours are rendered off-display while nobody touches (refreshed every 2 s),
//   so a drag's first frame comes ~15 ms after the DRAG_PX that make it a drag; one not ready is rendered then
//   (lv_snapshot, ~30-40 ms). In-place changes and screen loads render the new picture when they start.
// - Pager drags: slide_pager() takes over a pager's finger drags. The drag is recognised in the touch read (before
//   LVGL acts on it), then followed outside LVGL: the neighbour page comes in under the finger, the ends resist and
//   bounce back, release past a third or a flick goes on, else back. Then pager_switch() and LVGL takes over again.
//   DRAG_PX is Kconfig FORGE_SLIDE_DRAG_PX (menu "espforge LVGL", 10 by default: LVGL's own; 28 when a tap or a hold
//   with a slight finger move became a swipe, esp32-s3-colormesh). List scrolls are decided at 10 px whatever it is.
// - In-place changes (slide_change) and screen loads (slide_to): the old picture slides out, the new one in.
// Everything runs in the LVGL task with the display lock held. Without the board's panel hooks or PSRAM for two
// pictures, the same calls fall back to LVGL's own animation (or none). Log lines: "slide: ...". Test console:
// "slide" answers "test: slide drag_px=N scroll_px=N lvgl_px=N drags=N scrolls=N hooked=N dropped=N" (since boot);
// "slide hold X Y MS X2 Y2 [MOVE_MS [END_MS]]" holds a simulated finger, then moves it on.

// axis; with none that way it stays LVGL's (a list scrolling, a gesture). Neighbour pictures are kept for both: up to
// 4 x 434 KB of PSRAM, allocated when a picture needs one and PSRAM has room (slide_slots.c's rules, from MeteoBus).

// at the next tick that notices). Called from the touch read (LVGL task, display lock held, before LVGL handles that
// read): set flags, log, no screen loads or object deletes, nothing slow (the drag's first frame waits). One hook;
// NULL removes it. From esp32-s3-colormesh.

// the lift; the pressed object gets PRESS_LOST then). From an LVGL event handler (LVGL task, display lock held); no
