# The display in the browser

The app's own screens, compiled to WebAssembly with Emscripten: LVGL at the firmware's version with the display's
settings, the app's `main/` sources (`main.c`, `ui.c`, `app_text.c`), the framework's components (forge_lvgl's pager
and moves drawn as pictures, forge_core's i18n and text fit, forge_net's service statuses, forge_ota's settings page
routes), all unchanged. Only the hardware is replaced. The settings page (`main/web/index.html`, unchanged) runs
beside it in an iframe, served by the firmware's own route handlers. On the flasher site it is *Try it in your
browser* (`try/`). It came from [weather_amoled](https://github.com/TheMonkeyz/esp32-s3-weather)'s `web/emu`
(October 4-6) and rtc_quebec's port of it (October 6).

## What stands in for what

| File | Stands in for |
|---|---|
| `emu_display.c` | the panel (`board.h`'s display half and `board_init()`): a `DISP_W` x `DISP_H` RGB565 framebuffer that `emu-page.js` copies to the canvas when it changed; slide.c's raw frames; `display_brightness()` dims the canvas (a CSS filter, 0 is black) |
| `emu_touch.c` | the touch chip (`board.h`'s touch half): the mouse or a finger on the canvas, for LVGL and for slide.c's own reads |
| `emu_http.c` | `esp_http_client` (and so forge_core's `http_once`): a `fetch()`, polled until it answers (ASYNCIFY) |
| `emu_nvs.c` | NVS: a small table saved in the page's `localStorage` (`<app>_emu_nvs`) on each commit |
| `emu_tasks.c` | FreeRTOS tasks, queues, binary semaphores: each task an Emscripten fiber, run by the main loop between LVGL frames; a wait inside a task goes back to the main loop |
| `emu_time.c` | `localtime_r` following `TZ` as the firmware sets it (Emscripten's uses the browser's zone) |
| `emu_web.c` | the web server: the settings page's `/api/` requests, queued by the page and served between LVGL frames by the app's and forge_ota's handlers; `/api/info` as forge_net's; Wi-Fi scan and save answer that they need the real display |
| `emu_stubs.c` | Wi-Fi (a saved network, joined at once: `main.c` goes straight to what it does once Wi-Fi is up), the setup network and Easy Connect (never start), updates (none; Restart reloads the page), diagnostics and the test console (none: the log is the browser's console), the NTP service (the browser's clock) |
| `emu_loop.c` | the LVGL task and the scheduler: `app_main()` as a task, then tasks, settings page requests, `lv_timer_handler()`, `emscripten_sleep()`, forever |
| `shim/` | the ESP-IDF and FreeRTOS headers the firmware includes; `vTaskDelay` hands control back to the browser |

The app has one `#ifdef EMU_BUILD`: `ui.c` finds its font as an array (`ttf_start[]`, `*ttf_end`) instead of
ESP-IDF's `asm("_binary_montserrat_ttf_start")` symbols, which WebAssembly can't place (`embed.py`).

## Build (WSL)

Emscripten 6.0.11 (the version CI uses):

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git ~/emsdk && ~/emsdk/emsdk install 6.0.11 && ~/emsdk/emsdk activate 6.0.11
```

From Windows, after one firmware build (it fetches LVGL into `managed_components/lvgl__lvgl`):

```bash
wsl bash -lc 'source ~/emsdk/emsdk_env.sh && make -C /mnt/c/Users/<you>/ESPDEV/<app>/web/emu -j8'
```

A build from scratch takes about a minute (LVGL, over `/mnt/c`); then `build/` has `index.html`, `emu.js`, `emu.wasm`
(~0.9 MB), `emu-page.js`, `settings.html`, `emu-settings.js` and `fonts/`. cJSON is ESP-IDF's (`IDF_PATH`, default
`/mnt/c/Espressif/esp-idf`); `make LVGL=<lvgl> CJSON=<folder>` points elsewhere. Serve `build/` over HTTP
(`file://` can't load WebAssembly): `.claude/launch.json` "emulator" (port 8767), or
`python -m http.server 8767 -d web/emu/build`. Another session may already serve another checkout on that port: pick
another one, or the page shows the other checkout's build.

- `make config`: after changing LVGL options or the app's Kconfig values, regenerates `lv_kconfig.h` and
  `sdkconfig.h` from `build/v55/sdkconfig` (`SDKCONFIG=` for another); commit both, CI doesn't build the firmware
  first.
- `make try F=../../main/ui.c`: compile one file, show its first errors.
- `node web/emu/forge/smoke.js` (Playwright from `tools/webtest`, `npm ci` there): serves `build/` and checks in
  headless Chromium, with real mouse events, that the screen draws, a drag to the left shows another page, a press and
  hold changes the screen, the settings page reads `/api/info`, choosing its second language changes the screen, and
  that nothing logs an error. Screenshots of each step in `build/smoke/`: look at them. CI runs it after the build.
- From a git worktree without `managed_components` of its own: `make LVGL=<main checkout>/managed_components/lvgl__lvgl`.

## What an app provides

1. `Makefile`: `APP_SRC` (the `main/` files that build for the browser: usually all of `main/CMakeLists.txt`'s SRCS),
   `APP_EMU` (its `emu_*.c` files), `EMBED` (`name=path` for each embedded file its code reads), and if it uses more
   of the framework than the starter, `FORGE_CORE` / `FORGE_NET` ... (e.g. `FORGE_CORE += png_rows.c`; `http_once.h` is header-only).
2. `emu_main.c`: `main()`. Usually demo data a first visitor should see (a place, a stop), `?parameters` from the
   page's address (`emu_param`), then `emu_start_app_main(); emu_loop();`. An app whose `main.c` can't run here writes
   that part itself (weather_amoled's `emu_main.c` fetches and shows the forecast in its own loop, `emu_step()`).
3. `index.html`: the page's words (what to try, what needs the real display) and look; keep the element ids
   `emu-page.js` uses (`screen`, `status`, `settings`) and its two scripts.
4. The one `#ifdef EMU_BUILD` for each embedded file (`embed.py`'s docstring).
5. Its own hardware: a stand-in in `web/emu` (in `APP_EMU`) and, if the driver's headers aren't in `shim/`, a header
   next to it (`web/emu` comes first on the include path). weather_amoled's are examples: `emu_audio.c` (the speaker
   and microphones through `esp_codec_dev`, played with Web Audio, the browser's microphone when the visitor turns it
   on), `emu_imu.c` (the motion sensor: a phone's `devicemotion`, or a "Pick it up" button) and `emu_partition.c` (a
   flash partition, in memory). A C function the page calls goes in `APP_EXPORTS` (`APP_EXPORTS := ,_emu_mic`); the
   page reaches the module through `window.emuReady`.

What fails to link is what the app uses and the browser lacks: stub it in the app's `web/emu` file, or, if every
app would need it, in `forge/`.

## On the flasher site

`python tools/make_flasher_site.py site --stable dist --emu web/emu/build` copies `build/`'s files to the site's
`try/` and adds `"try": "try/"` to `channels.json`; the flasher page then links to it ("No board at hand? Try it in
your browser"). `index.html` uses the site's font from `../fonts/` (the build copies it to `build/fonts/` for local
use).

CI (`.github/workflows/firmware.yml`, job `emulator`) builds it on every push, from the latest stable release (the tag
itself when a stable tag is pushed; a release older than the emulator has no `web/emu`, and then the pushed commit is
built, said in the log), with LVGL from GitHub at `main/idf_component.yml`'s version, cJSON 1.7.19 (ESP-IDF 5.5.4's)
and Emscripten 6.0.11, then runs the smoke test (screenshots: artifact `emulator-smoke`). The `pages` job adds it to
the site; if the emulator build or its smoke test fails, the site is published without it.

## Notes

- One thread: the tasks, the settings page's requests and LVGL take turns; LVGL never runs while a task does, as the
  display lock guarantees on the board. A task's wait (`vTaskDelay`, `ulTaskNotifyTake`, a queue, a semaphore, an
  HTTP request) switches back to the main loop; a wait in the main loop is an `emscripten_sleep`. At most 6 tasks
  (`MAX_TASKS`), 256 KB of C stack each whatever the firmware asks.
- A click can start and end between two of LVGL's touch reads: `emu_touch.c` holds a new press until LVGL has read
  it. Only a new press is held, never a move, and `touch_forget()` drops it: a drag (slide.c) reads the finger itself,
  and a press held from its moves reached LVGL after the drag as a tap (weather_amoled: every day swipe closed the
  hourly view, October 4).
- The settings page's requests are served by the main loop (`emu_web_poll()`), never inside a call from JavaScript:
  a handler may wait (forge_ota's update POST does), and ASYNCIFY can't unwind a call made while the main loop is
  itself suspended. The frame can start before the page around it has run its script: `emu-settings.js` waits for
  `emuApi`. Its key is `#k=0000000000000000` (`web_key()`); no key is checked.
- A request is a plain `fetch()` with no header of ours: a page can't set `User-Agent`, and a custom header turns
  every request into a CORS preflight. The service must answer cross-origin requests (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`).
  A request polls for its answer: an await inside a fiber isn't safe with ASYNCIFY. The screen pauses while the main
  loop waits for one.
- Emscripten's `strftime("%z")` ignores `TZ` too (it wrote local time as +00:00, esp32-s3-rtcquebec): compute an
  offset from the date (`mktime` of the local fields against the UTC time), as its `rtc_iso_local` does (LESSONS L196).
- `png_rows.c` (map tiles, pictures) inflates with the ROM's tinfl on the board: an app that adds it
  (`FORGE_CORE += png_rows.c`) gets miniz 3.0.2's tinfl here, downloaded once into `build/miniz`.
- The board's `touch_set_press_filter()` works here too (`emu_touch.c`): a press the app refuses is no press.
- A hidden tab pauses `requestAnimationFrame` (the canvas updates only when shown) and slows timers.
- `?lang=fr` in the address starts the starter app in French (`emu_main.c`), as if chosen on the settings page.
